IDASrvr2 has been moved to an x64 compile for IDA7+

The primary client lib ref implementation is in IDAJScript
the client libs in this folder have not been updated but only
require a couple tweaks as the api has not really changed just
the window messages now have a 2 on the end of them and the existing
api has been seamlessly extended to now accept x64 numbers

the activexclient lib was updated 10.3.20
